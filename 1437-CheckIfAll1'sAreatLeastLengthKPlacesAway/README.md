Given an binary array nums and an integer k, return true if all 1's are at least k places away from each other, otherwise return false.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	0 <= k <= nums.length
	nums[i] is 0 or 1
